# Blibliki Grid

Blibliki Grid is acting as the visual counterpart to the [Blibliki Engine](https://github.com/blibliki-js/engine), it bridges the gap between the technical complexity of synthesizer creation and the intuitive ease of visual interaction.  Blibliki Grid enhances this by offering a way to visually orchestrate and manipulate your sonic experiments.
